I am a Master's student of Mathematics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil. My main research interests currently are Functional Analysis, specially Banach Space Theory and Operator Theory, and Set-Theoretic Topology. That being said, I'm very much interested in exploring other math-related areas.
