Essentially, spectral theory seeks to further the study of eigenvalues for the case of linear operators \(T:X \to X\) on infinite dimensional spaces \(X\).

For that purpose, while the standard definition of an eigenvalue still works (that is, \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) such that \(\text{Ker}(T-\lambda I) \neq \{0\}\)), it needs to be complemented to take care of "infinite dimensional artifacts" that these perturbations \(\lambda I\) can employ which could cause troubles when inverting or handling the inversion of \(T-\lambda\).

We call the set of these "disturbing perturbations" \(\lambda\) the spectrum of ùëá and it consists of 3 disjoint parts:
- The discrete spectrum, where \(\lambda\) are such that \(T-\lambda I\) "can't be reversed", that is, \(\text{Ker}(T-\lambda I) \neq \{0\}\) (which accounts for the eigenvalues).
- The continuous spectrum, where \((T-\lambda I)\) is invertible on a dense subset of the domain, but it's inverse is unbounded.
- The residual spectrum, which accounts for perturbations \(\lambda\) whose inversion is bounded but isn't valid for a "sufficiently large" domain (\(\overline{\text{Dom}(R_\lambda)} \neq X\)).

While the discrete spectrum inherits the geometric intuition of it's finite dimensional counterpart, the reasoning behind the two remaining spectra isn't immediate. To that end I share one interesting way I saw (in a StackExchange thread linked bellow) to interpret the continuous spectrum:

If the resolvent operator \(R_\lambda = (T-\lambda I)^{-1}\) is unbounded, we have a sequence \((x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) in the unit sphere whose image under \(R_\lambda\) diverges to infinity. As \(R_\lambda\) represents a way to reverse the transformation \(T - \lambda\), we may use it to translate the sequence \((x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) to \(\text{Dom}(T)\), and normalizing the vectors, construct a sequence 
\[
\tilde{x}_n = \frac{R_\lambda(T)x_n}{\|R_\lambda(T)x_n\|}, \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
\]
in the unit ball of \(X\) such that \((T-\lambda)x_n \to 0\).

That is, the continuous spectrum represents the set of scalars whose corresponding "perturbed transformation" have a sequence on the unit sphere along which it's behavior approximates that of an eigenvector for \(\lambda\).
