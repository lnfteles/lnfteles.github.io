Final undergraduate thesis (in english) for my degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. These notes consist of an introduction to the applications of Ramsey theory to Banach space theory.

In short we give a brief introduction to Ramsey theory and discuss Ellentuck's topology and Galvin-Prikry's theorem. In the second chapter we follow a proof for Krivine's theorem for real Banach spaces.
