In the second semester of 2024 (July-December) I acted as the Teaching Assistant for professor [Rogério Fajardo](https://www.ime.usp.br/~fajardo/) in the course ["Elements of Set Theory" (MAT0331)]https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAT0331) for undergraduates.

Teaching Assistant responsabilities
------
In Brazil we use the term "monitor" for this position, and as the expectations for what a "teaching assistant" would do may vary from country to country I list bellow exactly what I did:
* I graded the problem sheets of the students.
* I held one weekly 1-hour session to help the students learn the subject and solve problems.
* I did not grade tests.
* I did not give any lectures.
