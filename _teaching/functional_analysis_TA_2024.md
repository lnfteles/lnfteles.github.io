In the first semester of 2024 (February-June) I acted as the Teaching Assistant for professor [Vinícius Morelli](https://www.ime.usp.br/vinimc/) in the course ["Introduction to Functional Analysis"](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/course/view.php?id=116390&section=0#tabs-tree-start) (MAT0334/MAT5721) for both undergraduates and post-graduates.

Teaching Assistant responsabilities
------
In Brazil we use the term "monitor" for this position, and as the expectations for what a "teaching assistant" would do may vary from country to country I list bellow exactly what I did:
* I graded the problem sheets of the students (only the portion of the problem sheets that actually).
* I held two weekly 1-hour sessions to help the students learn the subject and solve problems.
* I did not grade tests.
* I did not give any lectures.


Topics explored in MAT0334
------
What and introductory course in Functional Analysis tackles might also change depending on the university and lecturer, so I list bellow some of the main topics discussed throughout the semester (these are only a small sample of topics taken from the problem sheets and don't represent the depth to which these topics were explored):
* Normed and Banach spaces.
* Equivalent norms and bounded linear operators.
* $\ell_p$ spaces.
* The Hahn-Banach theorem, adjoint operators and reflexivity.
* The Uniform Boundedness Principle, the Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem.
* Hilbert spaces.
