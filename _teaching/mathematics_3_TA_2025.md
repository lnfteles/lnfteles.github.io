For the second semester of 2025 (July-Ongoing) I am the Teaching Assistant for professor [Daniel Levcovitz](https://www.ime.usp.br/daniel.levcovitz/) in the course ["Mathematics III" (CCM0213)](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?nomdis=&sgldis=CCM0213) for undergraduates of the Bachelor in Molecular Sciences.

Teaching Assistant responsabilities

In Brazil we use the term "monitor" for this position, and as the expectations for what a "teaching assistant" would do may vary from country to country I list bellow exactly what I do:
* I hold weekly 1-hour sessions to help the students learn the subject and solve problems.
* I do not grade tests.
* I do not give any lectures.
